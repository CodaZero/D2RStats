# D2RStats


Testing site used to mark down stats in Diablo 2. Not supposed to replace or compete with the main sites out there, Just mainly used for practice and for me to easily see stats without having to refer to my book.

Completed: 

In Progress: Landing Page. Sheets for all class data. Sheets for all enemy types, stats and more. 

Possibly adding: Some type of forum page (Obv not needed but would be cool to see if getting one up would even be possible with githubpages.) A build maker, Maybe with a way for people to publish builds. Might not work very well. May have to use contact email to send builds for me to put on the site.
